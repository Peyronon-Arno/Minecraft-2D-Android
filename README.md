# Minecraft-2D-Android

This is a simple andoird application. 
The goal is to "create" a video game. 
This project had to be done in a group of two.
We decided to play Minecraft in 2D.

Action possible : 

Select a size for the world. Then you're on the playing activity and you can move Steve (main characeter)
You can also see the list of items used for the generation of the map

All the code is documented and there is explaination of the project, UML doc and case usages doc in french.

Have fun :)
